In Java, when passing objects as parameters to methods, that actually also iss passing references to the objects, not the objects themselves. This means when someone modify the state of an object within a method, the changes are reflected in the original object outside of the method.

swap(Object o1, Object o2):
In this method, we are swapping the references o1 and o2, but we're not modifying the actual objects they reference.
When someone pass jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD to this method, that is passing references to the actual DigitalVideoDisc objects.
Swapping the references o1 and o2 doesn't affect the original references jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD outside of the method.
Therefore, after calling swap, the titles of jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD remain unchanged.

changeTitle(DigitalVideoDisc dvd, String title):
In this method, we're modifying the state of the DigitalVideoDisc object referenced by dvd by changing its title.
When someone pass jungleDVD to this method, that means passing a reference to the actual DigitalVideoDisc object.
Inside the method, we're modifying the title of the DigitalVideoDisc object using the reference dvd.
Therefore, after calling changeTitle, the title of jungleDVD is changed.
